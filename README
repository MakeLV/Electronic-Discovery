Electronic Discovery or ED as I like to call it is a toy built with the purpose of encouraging and engaging kids imaginations. Lots of different things can be built to allow different feedback through light and sound based on various combinations of pots and buttons. The components are able to be arranged creatively in a face-like pattern allowing for a friendly and inviting appearance, drawing the child a bit more into the project.
